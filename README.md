*Syllabusses designed by me for the courses I taught/assisted at various levels.*

If you're a law student, the syllabusses and suggested readings might be helpful in guiding your trips to the library. In case you're unable to procure any of the suggested materials, let me know and I'll see if I can get it for you.

If you're a professor teaching any of these subjects, feel free to follow the sample syllabus or suggest changes (both for syllabus as well as suggested readings).

Best, 

Anshuman
